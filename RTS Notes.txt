To do list for when unity finsihes their new multiplayer: (basically a full rework)
- get units moving (some sort of bug is stopping them atm)
- create very simple lobby for players with new model in 1 map (flat land)
- get players spawning on the map
- players need to be able to independantly move camera by hiting sides of screen and with arrow keys
- get seperate ui/build menu working for palyers
- camera should be able to keep moving even when opening build menu (no waits etc)
- get buildings spawning
- get battalions spawning from buildings
- get battalions moving
- get battalions avoiding buildings
- get battalions avoiding each other
- get battalions fighting buildings
- get battalions fighting other battalions
- get farm generating income for player

Notes:
+ Unity's multiplayer is being depreciated. Therefore a new model will be implemented in this app that will be easily transitionable to the new system when it releases.
+ This project will try to implement a simpler client server model, just to get the multiplayer working
+ remove collisions between soliders it's just an irritation to the player (and very hard to program for!)
 	-but soliders shouldn't be able to stick on the same spot as another soldier (if touching, pick area 1m away and move to that)
